			At Garden Cattery our standards of care, security and hygiene will ensure the best environment for your cat. When booking you will be asked about your cat’s health, what their favourite food is, and their likes and dislikes so that we can ensure they have a happy and healthy stay with us.

			We have 25 pens which includes 4 doubles and one larger one that can take a family of up to 5 cats.
