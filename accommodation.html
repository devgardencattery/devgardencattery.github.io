			At Garden Cattery our standards of care, security and hygiene will ensure the best environment for your cat. When booking you will be asked about your cat’s health, what their favourite food is, and their likes and dislikes so that we can ensure they have a happy and healthy stay with us.

			We have recently taken over this beautiful cattery and are implementing a program of changes to further improve your cat’s comfort during their stay with us, and to make it as much as a home for them as possible.

			Our penthouse cabins are fully insulated and each one has a heater for year-round comfort.  Heating is provided as when the temperature falls below 16&deg;C (61&deg;F), regardless of the time of year.  We also have our own generator to provide power in case of power cuts to the pens.  During warm weather fans are placed throughout the cattery to keep the cats at a comfortable temperature.
		</p>
		<p class="normaltext">
			The cabins at Garden Cattery are penthouses so that the cats have as much room as possible to roam about. The ladder up to the sleeping compartment is at a shallow angle, and the rungs are thick, so that cats of all abilities can scale them with ease.
