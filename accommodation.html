			Your Cat's Safety

		<p class="normaltext">
			The comfort safety of your cat are our top concerns. Garden Cattery benefits from being in the garden of our home, and our bedroom overlooks the cattery so we can keep an eye on the cats staying with us.
			<br><br>
			Garden Cattery has been built to the <a href="http://www.icatcare.org/publication/standard-construction-and-management-boarding-catteries" target="_blank">International Cat Care (ICC) guidelines</a>, previously Feline Advisory Bureau (FAB). We are fully licensed by <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1963/43" target="_blank">South Norfolk District Council</a>, and we are comprehensively covered by Petplan insurance. All of these documents are on display in our reception area for viewing.
