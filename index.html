			Garden Cattery, which is 13 miles south of Norwich,  is home to myself, Susan, and my husband Shane, along with our own cat, Chloe.  We are lifelong cat lovers and your cat(s) will be looked after as though they were our own whilst they are in our care.
		</p>
		<p class="normaltext">
			Open all year round the cattery is situated in our back garden and is perfect for us to be able to keep an eye on all our boarders whilst they play, snooze or just watch the world go by.  The pens are in a courtyard setting with bird feeders and a newly installed water feature to keep the cats amused and interested during their stay.

			The comfort and wellbeing of our boarding cats is paramount to us and to that end the cattery has been built to the International Cat Care (ICC), previously Feline Advisory Bureau (FAB), guidelines. 
		</p>
		<p class="normaltext">
			We know all cats are different, react differently to being boarded and have their own unique characters, which is why we like to get to know them (on their own terms of course!) so that they get the individual attention they need whilst away from their normal environment.
