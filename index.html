			<p>
				Welcome to Garden Cattery, home to myself Susan and husband Shane along with Chloe our own cat.  The cattery is situated in our back garden and is perfect for us to be able to keep an eye on all our boarders whilst they play, snooze or just watch the world go by.  The pens are in a courtyard setting with bird feeders and a water feature to also keep the cats amused and interested during their stay.
			</p>
			<p>
				The cattery has been built to the Feline Advisory Bureau Guidelines and the comfort and wellbeing of our boarding cats is paramount to us.  We know all cats are different and react differently to being boarded and have their own unique characters, so we like to get to know them <img src="images/02_chloeCattery.JPG" alt="" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10">(on their terms of course!) so they get the individual attention they need whilst away from their normal environment.  Our standards of care, security and hygiene will ensure the best environment for your cat.

				When booking you will be asked about your catâ€™s health, what their favourite food is, <img src="images/03_catteryEndGarden.JPG" alt="" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10">and their likes and dislikes so that we can ensure they have a happy and health stay with us.
